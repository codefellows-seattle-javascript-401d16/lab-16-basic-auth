# Basic Authorization

# This project was to use basic auth middleware for parsing basic auth headers, and the user model we created has a unique username and tokenSeed, an email, and then we gave the user a method for generating a token from the findHash.

# We used the body-parser express middleware on our POST routes and used the express Router to create an auth router with routes for both signup (POST) and login (GET).

# We then wrote tests to ensure our routes worked.
